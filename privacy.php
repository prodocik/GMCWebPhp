                                <h4>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h4>
                                <p>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.</p>

                                <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
                                <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>
                                <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <bold>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 404-478-6454 or via <a href="mailto:info@georgiamotorcoach.com">email</a>. </bold>
