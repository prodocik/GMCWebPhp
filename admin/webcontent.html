									<h4>Gemini description</h4>
									<textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80" class="form-control">*No miles or generator included The easiest RV in our fleet to drive and park. Super fuel efficient Ford Transit chassis handles more like a sports car than a truck. Tight steering and
										suspension and an aerodynamic front make this RV great for getting around. A large rear means that this RV has plenty of room for 2 or a couple with 1 small child. Book early, this RV is very popular. It's the perfect size for a couple that wants a
										stress-free trip, but still wants comfortable sleeping. Queen bed slides out in the back bedroom. Lots of overhead and outside cabinets provide an exceptional amount of storage. Has duel heat (electric heat pump w/ propane backup) and a 3-way fridge
										(DC/AC/Propane), so you use minimal propane while driving or plugged in. For extra comfort, this RV is equipped with a tankless water heater for endless hot water and low propane consumption. With a full hookup you can shower whenever you are ready,
										for as long as you want. No more waiting for water to heat. Connection hoses are included. Free on-site parking available. For your convenience, leave your car and drive off in the RV. Please note: This RV is not suitable for camping more than 2
										nights without power hookup in hot weather due to limited propane supply for generator.</textarea>
